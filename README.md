# Argos_Project
Using the argos Large-scale robot simulation to create a path planning feature to able have automation to communicate each other, and able to reach the target location quickly as possible.

## Instructions:

When you clone the project, there will be some issues with the "cmake" command because the CMakeCache.txt has a differnt path compared to the original, but if you don't want to all that work, i'll recommend going to the official argos github website "https://github.com/ilpincy/argos3.git". It comes with instructions for downloading the packages and show you how to run the simulation. 

How i've implemented is in the VM VirtualBox using ubuntu, and to be able run the program you'll have use the ubuntu terminal instead of the VSCode Terminal because the compiler are different from each other.
